# Check Types, then add's Solution

```js
checkValidity_add(num_floor, string_butt)
    returner = 0
    valid_floor = false
    valid_butt = false

    // do a lot of comparisons
    //if they are valid, set them to true
    if (valid_floor & valid_butt)
        returner = num_floor - string_butt

    return returner
END checkValidity_add

// copy-paste their solution here
```
