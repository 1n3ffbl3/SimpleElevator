# reverseEngineer-from-allowed-results's Solution

```js
reverse_engineer (floor_num, string_butt)
    returner = 0
    outputs 
    for each in outputs
        try adding Number(string_butt)
        does it equal floor_num?

// copy-paste their solution here
```

## Solution Explanation

We know there are only a small set of possible outputs. We will try to reconstruct the input types and values by going backwards through a "typical" solution process.

If the results of this reverse-engineering match the arguments, all is good. Return the correct reverse-engineered return value.
